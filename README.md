# Dapp-voting-system

Voting with blockchain offers the potential to remove political election fraud and increase voter turnout, as was examined in the November 2018 midterm elections in West Virginia. Each vote would be saved as a block on the blockchain, making it virtually impossible to damage. The blockchain method would certainly additionally maintain transparency in the selecting process, reducing the employees needed to carry out an election and give authorities with instantaneous results.


## What is blockchain?
Blockchain is a decentralized technology that allows for secure data sharing. Blockchain is a type of distributed ledger for maintaining a permanent and tamper-proof record of transactional data. A blockchain functions as a decentralized database that is managed by computers belonging to a peer-to-peer P2P network. Each of the computers in the distributed network maintains a copy of the ledger to prevent a single point of failure and all copies are updated and validated simultaneously. Blockchain applications are being explored in many industries as a secure and cost-effective way to create and manage a distributed database and maintain records for digital transactions of all types. In this case, the "transactions" are votes, which are distributed across the decentralized network.
